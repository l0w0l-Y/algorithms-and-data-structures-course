### Task 1 (Circular list)
To solve the problem, you need to write your own implementation without using the built-in .Net data structures.
Let a circular list of N participants be given (participants differ by gender) of some game. The program should contain the following functionality:
* coding: creating a circular list of participants from a text file;
* decoding: restoring a set of participants according to a given list with the output of the result to a text file, with the release of the allocated dynamic memory;
* inserting an element into the list: inserting a new member into the list;
* removing an element from the list: removing a participant from the list;
* by selecting some element as the initial one, sort the initial list;
* starting the report from the first one, create a procedure for deleting each k-th (the value is set by the user), closing the circle after each deletion. Set Last Remaining Member;
* two groups playing decide to unite. Build a new list from two existing ones;
* build two lists from the list of participants, consisting of men and women, respectively;
